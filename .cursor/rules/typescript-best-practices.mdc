- Enable strict mode in your `tsconfig.json` for better type checking.
- Use type inference where possible to reduce unnecessary type annotations.
- Leverage utility types like `Partial`, `Readonly`, and `Pick` for more expressive types.
- Implement custom type guards for runtime type checking and narrowing.

- Use `useQuery` for fetching data and `useMutation` for creating, updating, or deleting data.
- Implement proper query keys to enable efficient caching and refetching.
- Utilize `queryClient.invalidateQueries` to update related queries after mutations.
- Set appropriate stale times and cache times for optimal performance and freshness.
